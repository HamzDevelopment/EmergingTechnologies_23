    "Quantum computing is a groundbreaking approach to computation that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics. It differs significantly from classical computing in several key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Qubits:** Quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, as the basic unit of information. Unlike classical bits, which are either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a state of superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Superposition:** This quantum property allows qubits to represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, offering the potential for parallel computation on a scale that is unattainable by classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Quantum Entanglement:** Another unique aspect of quantum computing is entanglement, where the state of one qubit is directly related to the state of another, regardless of the distance between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Quantum Gates:** In quantum computing, operations are performed using quantum gates. These gates manipulate the state of qubits and are the building blocks of quantum circuits. Unlike classical logic gates, quantum gates can create superposition and entanglement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Quantum Circuits:** A quantum circuit is a sequence of quantum gates, designed to perform a specific computation. The complexity and potential of a quantum circuit exceed that of traditional computing circuits."
